# Lane: performance

**Mission.** Hold LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, critical path < 200KB gzipped, and the fewest requests per page.

**Owns.** vite.config.ts, src/App.tsx (lazy routes), hooks with queries, bundle-budget-baseline.json, dom-budget-baseline.json

**Backlog.** Open stories in `prd.json` with prefix WEB-PERF. See `../README.md` for the loop.

## Handoff

None. WEB-PERF-060 closed in loop 6: Spinner/LoadingSpinner moved to
src/components/ui/spinner.tsx and ProtectedRoute imports from there, so
loading-skeleton.tsx (and skeleton.tsx) left the entry chunk (critical path
181.9 -> 180.8 KB gz, baseline ratcheted). src/__tests__/entryChunkSkeleton.test.ts
walks the static import graph from src/main.tsx; reuse its walker if another
module needs pinning out of the entry. Next biggest entry-chunk residents
(source map of the built index chunk): App.tsx 42 KB raw, tailwind-merge
20 KB, AuthContext 15 KB, react-helmet-async 12 KB, icon-sprite.generated.tsx
3.6 KB. A local build needs placeholder VITE_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY/SITE_URL
exported or the html-env plugin aborts. The open WEB-PERF stories (023, 031,
034, 035) are all waiting on a migration being applied or on live data for
the prerender.
